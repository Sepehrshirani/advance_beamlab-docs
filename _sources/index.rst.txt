   .. grid-item-card:: Which method should I use?
      :link: choosing
      :link-type: doc

      A decision guide keyed on the data you have, with what this package
      actually demonstrates for each method, including the cases where a
      plain LCMV is the better answer.

   .. grid-item-card:: Interactive panel
      :link: panel
      :link-type: doc

      An interactive panel. Put one, two or three sources on a cortex, pick a
      rhythm and how correlated they are, and watch the constraint table: LCMV's
      off-diagonal gain runs away and takes the amplitude with it, MCMV's stays
      pinned at zero.

   .. grid-item-card:: Examples
      :link: auto_examples/index
      :link-type: doc

      Nine worked examples, from the correlated-source problem in isolation
      through to real MEG recordings and a finite-element EEG head model. Every
      figure is produced by the code on the page.

   .. grid-item-card:: Mathematical background
      :link: background
      :link-type: doc

      Every equation derived from first principles, so each method can be
      understood and tuned without reading the papers first.

   .. grid-item-card:: Parameter tuning
      :link: tuning
      :link-type: doc

      What each parameter controls and what changes when you move it, per
      algorithm.

   .. grid-item-card:: API reference
      :link: api
      :link-type: doc

      Every public function and class, documented from its in-code docstring.
