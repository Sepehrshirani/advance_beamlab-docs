===================================
ABMC: localising spike-like sources
===================================

The adaptive Bayesian beamformer with multiple constraints (ABMC) targets
low-power, spike-like sources that a power-based beamformer localises poorly:
epileptic interictal discharges and delayed responses to stimulation.

The reason is that the two methods optimise different things. An LCMV beamformer
scans for **output power**, so at low SNR its map is driven by whatever carries
the most variance. ABMC instead scans for **agreement with a known waveform**:
its localiser is :math:`|\mathrm{corr}(\mathbf{w}^{\mathsf T}\mathbf{X}, u)|`,
the correlation between the beamformer output and a supplied template, at the
best lag. When the target is a transient of known morphology buried in noise,
that is a far more selective statistic than power.

This example shows four things on a spherical EEG model:

1. **Localisation maps** at a single source: ABMC's template-match map versus a
   noise-normalised LCMV power map across the whole grid.
2. **Accuracy across the volume**: the same spike placed at eight locations, with
   the ABMC and LCMV localisation error at each.
3. **Reconstructed source**: the recovered time course from both filters.
4. **A dictionary of templates**: :func:`~advance_beamlab.make_abmc_dictionary`
   localising several desired waveforms in one call.

The LCMV comparator throughout is :func:`mne.beamformer.make_lcmv` with
``weight_norm='unit-noise-gain'``. That normalisation matters: the *unnormalised*
unit-gain output power :math:`1/(\mathbf{g}^{\mathsf T}\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{g})`
scales as :math:`\|\mathbf{g}\|^{-2}`, so it is driven by wherever the leadfield
happens to be weakest rather than by where the source is. On this grid, with a
white covariance, it correlates with :math:`\|\mathbf{g}\|^{-2}` at 1.000 and
peaks on the weakest-leadfield point (index 4 of 301) -- not on the most
superficial one (index 106), which it never picks. A different covariance moves
the peak, but it keeps tracking the leadfield rather than the data. Comparing
against that would flatter ABMC for the wrong reason.

# **What Stage 1 actually does.** ABMC has two stages, and ``make_abmc`` runs the
# first internally, so it is easy to miss. Stage 1 is
# :func:`~advance_beamlab.sbl_covariance`: a Champagne-style type-II maximum
# likelihood fit of per-source prior variances :math:`\alpha` and a diagonal
# sensor noise :math:`\Lambda`, giving a *model* covariance
# :math:`R = G\alpha G^\mathsf{T} + \Lambda`.
#
# The point is not that :math:`R` is a better estimate of the sample covariance.
# It is that :math:`R` is a **generative model** with a diagonal :math:`\alpha`, so
# it carries no cross-source correlation structure. That structure is exactly what
# an LCMV beamformer exploits when it cancels correlated sources.
#
# The left panel is the fitted source power. It is informative: it puts the true
# source in the top handful of a 301-point grid. But it is *not* a localiser. Its
# own peak can sit several centimetres away. Stage 1 supplies a covariance that
# will not cancel correlated sources; the template constraint of Stage 2 is what
# turns that into a location. That division of labour is the method.
#
# The right panel is the eigenvalue spectrum of both covariances, and the honest
# reading of it is a negative one. It would be convenient to argue that the
# empirical covariance is too ill-conditioned to invert and that this is what
# forces the model. It is not. Over the dimensions this segment actually
# occupies the empirical covariance is well conditioned, as the panel title
# reports, and :func:`mne.beamformer.make_lcmv` inverts that very matrix a few
# cells further down to produce the LCMV map plotted below. The fitted
# :math:`R` is full rank by construction, which is convenient, but the reason to
# reach for it is the structural one above: a diagonal :math:`\alpha` carries no
# cross-source correlation for a beamformer to exploit.
