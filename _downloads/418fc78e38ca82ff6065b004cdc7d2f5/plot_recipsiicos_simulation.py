===========================================================
ReciPSIICOS versus LCMV as source correlation is dialled up
===========================================================

An LCMV beamformer minimises output power under a unit-gain constraint. When two
sources are correlated that is a trap: the filter can lower its own output power
by passing a scaled copy of the *other* source, which cancels the target it was
supposed to pass. The recovered amplitude collapses as the correlation rises.

ReciPSIICOS :footcite:`KuznetsovaEtAl2021` attacks this before the beamformer is
built. From the forward model alone it constructs a projector that suppresses the
cross-product (coupling) part of the sensor covariance while sparing the
auto-product (power) part, and applies it to the data covariance. The result
approximates the covariance that would have been measured had the same sources
been *uncorrelated*. An ordinary LCMV built on it therefore has nothing to
cancel.

This example dials the correlation from 0 to 0.99 and measures what each method
recovers, then shows how to choose the method's single free parameter, the
projection rank.

The head model matters here and is worth stating up front. The sources are
simulated, but they are simulated on the **real BEM forward** of the MNE
``sample`` dataset rather than on a sphere. ReciPSIICOS builds its projector
from the forward, so the forward decides how well the power and correlation
subspaces separate. On a single-shell sphere ``method='recipsiicos'`` barely
separates them at all -- measured on a 60-channel EEG sphere it keeps 0.99 of
the power subspace and 0.87 of the correlation subspace at :math:`K^*` -- which
leaves the automatic rank criterion nothing to lock onto. (``'whitened'``
separates cleanly even there, 0.83 against 0.16, so this is a property of the
projector rather than of spheres as such.) A realistic forward is the regime
the method was developed and validated in, and is what is used here.

See :ref:`ex-mcmv-simulation` for the same cancellation attacked from the other
direction, by constraining the sources jointly, and
:ref:`ex-recipsiicos-auditory` for this method run end to end on real recorded
data.

# **How sensitive is this to the rank?** Less than one might fear over the ranks
# that are valid, which is the useful practical finding. The top of the range
# needs more care than that sentence suggests, though, and the obvious metric is
# blind to the reason why.
#
# The bound is hard. Once the rank reaches the rank of the power Gram, which is
# the number of independent source topographies the forward supports, the
# whitened projector removes the entire power subspace and the modified
# covariance is exactly zero; the implementation warns when a requested rank
# crosses it. What makes this worth a figure rather than a footnote is that the
# recovered-amplitude metric cannot detect it. A unit-gain filter satisfies
# :math:`w^T g = 1` at the location it is pointed at whatever covariance it was
# built from, so past the bound it keeps reporting about one while the filter
# carries no information at all. The sweep below therefore reports a second
# quantity as well, the share of the whole power map falling on the two true
# sources, which has no such floor and does collapse.
