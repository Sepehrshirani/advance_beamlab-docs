======================================================
MCMV versus LCMV for correlated sources: a simulation
======================================================

Two temporally correlated sources are the textbook failure mode of the LCMV
beamformer. Because LCMV minimises output power under a unit-gain constraint, a
second source that is correlated with the target lets the filter place a null
that *cancels the target itself*: the recovered amplitude of a source shrinks by
a factor of :math:`1 - \rho^2` (in root-mean-square, :math:`\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}`)
as its correlation :math:`\rho` with the neighbour approaches one. At
:math:`\rho = 0.95` more than 90% of the power is lost.

The multi-source (MCMV) beamformer constrains both sources in one filter set, so
each filter passes its own source with unit gain while placing an *exact* null
on the other constrained source (Moiseev et al., 2011, Eq. 5). That exact null
is what LCMV lacks, and it is imposed by construction rather than estimated from
the data. MCMV therefore recovers the full amplitude at any correlation.

Two points are worth stating because they are easy to get wrong. First, this
cancellation does **not** require the sources to be spatially close: it is driven
by temporal correlation, not by leadfield overlap. The pair used below sits 8 cm
apart, and the example prints their normalised leadfield inner product so you can
see for yourself that cancellation is severe at a separation where the two
topographies are still far from identical. Second, it is an *idealised, high-SNR*
effect. Sensor noise and covariance
regularisation both push the recovered amplitude back up towards its true value,
which is exactly why the effect is dramatic in a clean simulation but mild on a
regularised real-data recording of moderately correlated sources.

We use a self-contained EEG sphere model (no dataset download) with a
fixed-orientation forward, inject a pair of sources whose correlation we control
directly, and reconstruct each source with a standard LCMV and with MCMV. To see
the cancellation we must read out the *physical* source amplitude, so both
beamformers use unit-gain weights (``weight_norm=None`` for
:func:`~mne.beamformer.make_lcmv`, ``"unit-gain"`` for
:func:`~advance_beamlab.make_mcmv`); a noise-normalised readout rescales the axis and
obscures the comparison.

# Build a self-contained EEG forward: a standard 10-20 montage on a
# single-shell sphere, converted to fixed orientation. Fixing the orientation
# keeps the comparison below clean. The true orientation is then known and
# shared by both beamformers, so any difference between them is the constraint
# and not an orientation search.
#
# It is worth saying what this is *not* for, because the opposite is easy to
# assume: ``pick_ori="max-power"`` does not escape the cancellation. On this
# fixture the two agree to within noise, a ratio of 1.00 at every correlation
# from 0.5 to 0.99, and they collapse together as the correlation rises.
#
# That agreement is not by itself the argument, and it is worth being straight
# about why. The volume grid gives every source the same normal, and the
# simulation injects along exactly that direction, so the fixed orientation here
# already *is* the true one and ``max-power`` has nothing left to find. A fixture
# built this way cannot test an orientation search. The argument is structural
# instead: re-optimising one source's orientation cannot undo a cancellation
# that comes from the *other* source sitting in the same filter.
