=======================================================
ReciPSIICOS beamforming of bilateral auditory responses
=======================================================

Correlated bilateral sources are the classic failure mode of the LCMV
beamformer: it minimises output power under a unit-gain constraint, so two
synchronous sources let it place a null that cancels them. ReciPSIICOS repairs
the *data covariance* by projecting out the cross-product (coupling) subspace,
so that an ordinary LCMV no longer cancels them.

This example runs ReciPSIICOS end to end on real, mixed-sensor MEG and contrasts
it with a standard LCMV. The recording is the auditory response of the MNE sample
dataset, whose left- and right-hemisphere sources are correlated across the N100:
r = +0.82 between the two traces a joint MCMV filter recovers there, as measured
in :ref:`ex-mcmv-auditory`.

A caveat stated up front, because the example reports it honestly below: on this
recording a plain LCMV already recovers both hemispheres, so ReciPSIICOS does
*not* beat it on hemispheric balance here. Signal cancellation is a high-SNR,
high-correlation effect that regularisation suppresses. What this example does
show is the whole real-data pipeline working: the rank curve and its 45-degree
criterion, the projector, the noise whitening across magnetometers and
gradiometers, and the virtual-sensor reduction. For the regime where the
cancellation is dramatic, and where this method demonstrably repairs it, see
:ref:`ex-recipsiicos-simulation`, which runs the same comparison on simulated
sources placed on this same realistic forward.

Two practical points, both important on real data. The projector is built from
the forward and must span where the data covariance's energy lives, so we use a
*whole-brain* grid, not a region. But the ``whitened`` correlation Gram is
:math:`O(N^2)`, so we decimate that grid to keep it tractable. And the
covariances are shrinkage-regularised, the correct estimator across the
magnetometer/gradiometer unit scales.

# covariance, which reads the coupling off the single trials rather than off the
# average, puts it at r = +0.55. Either way, estimate that correlation with the
# joint filter and not with a per-source LCMV, which reads the same pair as
# r = -0.09 through the very cancellation the correlation is meant to explain.
# The MCMV auditory example prints the joint and the per-source number together.
#
# Widening the window to 50-200 ms does not decorrelate the pair. Held at the two
# auditory vertices that example constrains, the correlation rises rather than
# washes out, to r = +0.94. What the wider window moves is the locations: the
# single-source LCMV peaks shift, the left one by 25 mm, out of superior temporal
# cortex. So the N100 is the active window because it is where the response
# lives, not because it is the only window with coupling for a correlated-source

# Compare the hemispheric balance: the ratio of the weaker to the stronger
# hemisphere peak. The textbook expectation is that a plain LCMV suppresses one
# side of a correlated pair while ReciPSIICOS retains both.
#
# **That is not what happens on this recording, and it is worth being explicit
# about it.** On the ``sample`` auditory data, at this SNR and with the usual
# ``reg=0.05``, a plain LCMV already recovers both hemispheres almost equally, so
# there is essentially no imbalance left for ReciPSIICOS to repair. The
# projection, which necessarily discards part of the covariance, comes at a small
# cost on this particular metric. Signal cancellation is an idealised, high-SNR,
# high-correlation effect: regularisation and sensor noise both push the
# recovered amplitudes back up. :ref:`ex-recipsiicos-simulation` dials the
# correlation directly and shows this method holding the amplitude LCMV loses.
#
# The honest summary is that this dataset demonstrates that ReciPSIICOS *runs
# correctly end to end on real, mixed-sensor MEG* (the rank curve, the projector,
# the whitening and the virtual-sensor reduction), and that it does not beat LCMV
# *on this balance metric*. It does recover a substantially larger waveform at
# the auditory peaks, which the last figure of this example shows.

# Finally, the reconstructed time courses at the two hemispheric peaks: the same
# comparison as the power map, now as a waveform. The ratio in each panel title
# is the ReciPSIICOS peak over the LCMV peak.
#
# These panels disagree with the balance metric above, and the disagreement is
# the interesting part rather than an inconsistency to smooth over. On
# hemispheric balance the two filters are close, because LCMV already recovers
# both hemispheres. On waveform amplitude at the auditory peaks they are not:
# ReciPSIICOS returns roughly four and a half times the LCMV peak on the left and
# about a third more on the right. That is not an artefact of the two weight
# normalisations, since the pre-stimulus baseline deviations are comparable
# between the two filters, so the peak signal-to-noise improves along with the
# amplitude.
#
# The two metrics are asking different questions. Balance asks whether each
# hemisphere shows up at all, and LCMV passes. Peak amplitude asks how much of
# the source survived the filter, and that is where cancellation leaves its mark.
