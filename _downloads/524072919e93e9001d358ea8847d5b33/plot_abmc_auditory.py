============================================
ABMC on a real recording, and where it stops
============================================

Every other ABMC demonstration in this package is a simulation, which is a fair
criticism of it: simulations are where a method is guaranteed to meet its own
assumptions. This example runs ABMC :footcite:`Shirani2024` on real MEG, the
auditory response of the MNE ``sample`` dataset, and reports the result whether
or not it flatters the method.

The paper's own cases are epileptic spikes and delayed responses to single-pulse
stimulation. The ``sample`` dataset has neither, but a single-trial auditory
evoked response is the same shape of problem: a short transient with a
reproducible morphology, known from the average, carrying a small share of the
trial's variance. That is the regime ABMC exists for.

There is no ground truth on real data, so "correct" has to be defined in advance
rather than judged by eye. Here it is anatomical: the primary auditory cortex is
the transverse temporal (Heschl's) gyrus, and both methods are scored by the
distance from their peak to the nearest grid point inside that label. The
comparison is against :func:`mne.beamformer.make_lcmv` on the same data.

The summary, which the numbers below reproduce. On a single trial ABMC is worse
than LCMV and wildly variable: a median of 32 mm across eight disjoint trials,
ranging from 5 to 46 mm, against 11 mm for LCMV. From two trials upwards its
median is never worse than LCMV's, but it is not uniformly better either: 9 mm
at two trials, 11 mm at four, 9 mm at eight and 7 mm at sixteen. The four-trial
point is the one to be careful with, because it sits on the LCMV line rather
than below it. The spread narrows sharply between one trial and two -- the
block range goes from 40.4 mm wide to 15.7 -- and after that only slowly, and
not monotonically: 13.2 mm at four trials, 8.5 at eight and 9.3 at sixteen. So
the method works here, but not at the signal-to-noise of one trial of this
recording.

Read the comparison knowing it is deliberately unfair to ABMC. LCMV is given the
whole recording, all 72 epochs, while ABMC is given between one and sixteen
trials, and ABMC still matches or beats it from two trials up. The asymmetry is
not hidden in the legend: it is drawn there. ABMC is not given only its own
trials either, and that cuts the other way: its template and noise covariance
both come from all 72 epochs, and only the segment being localised is short.

# Now ABMC, over a sweep of how many trials are averaged. Averaging raises the

# The single-trial point is the one to look at hardest, because it is the regime
# the method is aimed at and it is where the method loses. Its median is 32 mm
# against LCMV's 11, and its range runs from 5 mm to 46 mm, so a single trial of
# this recording decides almost nothing. From two trials up the medians are 9.0,
# 11.1, 9.0 and 6.8 mm against LCMV's 11.2, which is a clear win at two, eight
# and sixteen trials and a tie at four. Four trials is not a dip in the method
# so much as a reminder of how little separates these numbers: eight blocks of a
# 72-epoch recording, on a grid spaced at 3.4 mm.
#
# This is also why the sweep is scored on eight disjoint blocks rather than on
# the first one. Scored on the first single trial alone the answer is 5.1 mm,
# which would have read as ABMC beating LCMV by a factor of two at the hardest
# setting. That trial is the sixth best of the 72 available.
#
# One further result is worth singling out because it was different a day
# earlier. Before the automatic selection of ``P`` was made to reject values
# above ``critical_p``, this recording gave 53 mm at a single trial: the plateau
# rule had settled on the degenerate large-``P`` limit, which is a fixed point
# and so looks perfectly stable while localising badly. ``critical_p`` runs
# between 1.2 and 1.5 over the blocks of this sweep, about 1.4 at a single
# trial, so that constraint does real work on this dataset rather than guarding
# a case that never arises.

# The percentages annotated on the points are the share of the segment's
# variance carried by the evoked response. Even the single-trial point, at about
# 5 per cent, sits above the 0.14 to 1.05 per cent the simulation example works
# at, so this recording never reaches the low-variance regime the method is
# really aimed at. No dataset shipped with MNE-Python would: none of them
# contain epileptiform spikes. The simulation remains the place where ABMC is
# tested against a known answer. This example is the place where it meets a real
# recording, and the useful thing it establishes is the boundary: two trials of
# this data, not one.
