Leakage-free connectivity: pairwise and augmented MCMV
=========================================================

Functional connectivity is confounded by the spatial spread of the inverse
operator: a beamformer that leaks one region into another manufactures coupling
that is not there. This example shows, on a controlled simulation, how pairwise
MCMV (PW-MCMV) and augmented pairwise MCMV (APW-MCMV) remove that confound,
following Nunes et al. (2020).

We place three fixed-orientation sources in an EEG sphere model (no dataset
download):

- ``A`` and ``C`` sit about 2.4 cm apart, so ``A``'s leadfield overlaps ``C``'s;
- ``B`` is far from both;
- ``C`` is genuinely coupled to ``B`` (they share a slow amplitude envelope),
  while ``A`` carries an independent envelope.

``A`` and ``B`` therefore share no common drive. Their *realised* envelope
correlation over a finite recording is not exactly zero: an envelope is slowly
varying, so a recording holds only a limited number of independent envelope
samples and their sample correlation scatters about zero. Even so, that realised
value is known exactly here, and it is the target a good estimator should
reproduce. Yet two things can push an estimate away from it:

1. **Direct leakage / cancellation**: a single-source LCMV reconstructs each
   region with an independent filter, so :math:`\hat s_A` is a mixture of every
   active source and picks up ``B`` directly.
2. **Indirect leakage**: even after we forbid ``A`` and ``B`` from leaking into
   each other (a 2-source MCMV), :math:`\hat s_A` still contains a copy of the
   *conductor* ``C``; because ``C`` is coupled to ``B``, that copy correlates
   with :math:`\hat s_B` and a spurious edge survives.

PW-MCMV constrains :math:`\{A, B\}` jointly, so
:math:`\mathbf{w}_A^{\mathsf T}\mathbf{g}_B = 0` exactly and the *direct* path is
gone. APW-MCMV additionally adds the conductor ``C`` to the beamformer, which
places an exact null :math:`\mathbf{w}_A^{\mathsf T}\mathbf{g}_C = 0` and closes
the *indirect* path. The leakage coefficient
:math:`\alpha_C = \mathbf{w}_A^{\mathsf T}\mathbf{g}_C` is the sharpest summary:
nonzero for PW-MCMV, machine-zero for APW-MCMV.

Two details follow the paper. Connectivity is amplitude-envelope correlation
computed *plainly*, with no orthogonalisation, because MCMV already removes
leakage. The weights are built from a band-limited covariance matching the
analysis band.

# AR(1) null is designed to discard exactly such a small residual. On this
# simulation the spurious edge would never reach APW-MCMV at all. The two
# corrections are complementary rather than redundant.
#
# ``A``--``C`` being retained is the harder case, and it is not a failure of the
# estimator: PW-MCMV puts it at -0.143 against a realised truth of -0.151, so the
# *estimate* is accurate. What the screen is asking is whether a correlation that
# size could have arisen by chance from two independent slow envelopes, and over
# a finite recording that judgement is genuinely marginal. It is a reminder that
# the screen tests the observed statistic, not the generative model.
#
# **APW-MCMV connectivity.** To exercise the augmentation on the edge whose
# correction this example is about, we hand it a mask that includes ``A``--``B``
# as well, rather than the screen's own output. In a real analysis you would pass
